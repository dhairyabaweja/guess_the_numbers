# guess_the_numbers

It is a multiplayer game but a player plays one at a time.
Computer randomly chooses 3 consecutive nos. from  0 to 16 and you guess all the three nos. in minimum no. of guesses.
Every correct guess gives a "hit" message and every wrong guess gives a "miss" message.
When all the three nos. are guessed correctly you get a "kill" message.
